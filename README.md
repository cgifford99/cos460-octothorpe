# Octothorpe Console Game

## Background

Author: Christopher Gifford

Platform: Python 3.10 on Windows or Unix.

This program was written for COS 460/540: "Computer Networks" in Fall 2021. Octothorpe is a multiplayer console-based game that involves collecting treasures (denoted with the `#` character, AKA an octothorpe) in an ASCII-based map to achieve the highest score. The program supports as many clients as the server machine can handle and simply uses JSON to store user data.

## Usage

Usage of the provided client is optional, but recommended. To initialize the server and client, see their respective README documents.

In both cases, utilization of the provided Python virtual environment and the provided `requirements.txt` is recommended. To activate the virtual environment, in any bash console:

``` bash
# Activate the environment
source ./.venv/bin/activate
# Install all required packages
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## How to Play
